# positional-Salaries

Decision Tree Regression
Overview
This project implements a Decision Tree Regression model to predict salaries based on position levels using a dataset. The dataset used is Position_Salaries.csv, which contains position levels and their corresponding salaries.

Files
Position_Salaries.csv: Dataset for position levels and salaries.
decision_tree_regression.py: Python script with the implementation of the Decision Tree Regression model.
Setup
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decision-tree-regression.git
Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Python and pip installed, then run:
bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
Usage
Load the Dataset: Import the dataset from Position_Salaries.csv.
Train the Model: Use the DecisionTreeRegressor to fit the model to the data.
Predict and Visualize: Make predictions and visualize the regression results using Matplotlib.
Results
The project visualizes the Decision Tree Regression results with:

A scatter plot of the original data points.
A regression curve showing the model's predictions.
A smoothed curve for better visualization of the model's performance.
