# Position-Salaries

## **Decision Tree Regression**

### **Overview**

This project implements a **Decision Tree Regression** model to predict salaries based on position levels using the dataset **Position_Salaries.csv**. The dataset contains position levels and their corresponding salaries. 
The model uses a decision tree to learn the relationships between position levels and salaries and predict salaries for any given position level.

---

### **Files**

- **Position_Salaries.csv**: This CSV file contains data on position levels (from level 1 to level 10) and their corresponding salaries. It is the dataset used for training the Decision Tree model.
  
- **decision_tree_regression.py**: This Python script contains the implementation of the Decision Tree Regressor model. It includes steps for importing the dataset, training the model, and visualizing the results.

---

### **Setup**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Position-Salaries.git
   cd Position-Salaries

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python and pip installed, then run:
```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

---

### **Usage**

Load the Dataset: Import the dataset from Position_Salaries.csv using Pandas to load the data for training.

Train the Model: Use the DecisionTreeRegressor from sklearn.tree to fit the model to the data. This will allow the model to learn the relationship between position levels and salaries.

---

### **Predict and Visualize**:

Predictions: Use the trained model to predict the salary for any given position level.

Visualization: Visualize the regression results using Matplotlib, which includes:

-A scatter plot of the original data points.

-A regression curve showing the model's predictions.

-A smoothed curve for better visualization of the model's performance.

---

### **Results**
The project visualizes the Decision Tree Regression results in two ways:

Scatter Plot: Displays the original data points to show the relationship between position levels and salaries.

Regression Curve: Displays the model's predictions, helping visualize how well the decision tree model has fit the data.
The curve is smoothed to enhance visualization of the model's predictions.
